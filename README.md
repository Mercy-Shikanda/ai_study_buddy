# üß† AI Study Buddy - Flashcard Generator

Transform your study notes into interactive flashcards using AI! This project perfectly demonstrates how to build a practical AI-powered web application that solves real student problems.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Automatically generates 5 quiz questions from any study material
- **Interactive Flashcards**: Flip cards with smooth CSS animations
- **Previous Flashcards**: View and manage previously generated flashcard sets
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with gradients and animations
- **Real-time State Management**: Dynamic content updates without page refresh
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage for flashcard reuse

## üõ† Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure with modern elements
- **CSS3**: Advanced animations, gradients, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Interactive flip cards, state management, and API calls

### Backend
- **Python Flask**: RESTful API server
- **Supabase**: Cloud database for flashcard storage
- **AI Integration**: Hugging Face Question-Answering API

### AI Model
- **Hugging Face Router API**: GPT-OSS-120B model for high-quality question generation

## üìã How It Works

1. **User Input**: Student pastes study notes into HTML textarea
2. **AI Processing**: Python sends text to Hugging Face API with prompt: *"Generate 5 quiz questions"*
3. **Database Storage**: Generated flashcards saved to Supabase for reuse
4. **Interactive Display**: JavaScript creates flip cards with CSS animations
5. **State Management**: Tab system for new vs. previous flashcards

## üéØ Why It's Perfect for Learning

- **No Complex UI**: Simple text input/output interface
- **Teaches Core Concepts**:
  - **State Management** (JavaScript)
  - **Database Relationships** (Supabase)
  - **API Integration** (Hugging Face)
  - **Responsive Design** (CSS)
- **Solves Real Problems**: Instantly useful for students
- **Modern Patterns**: RESTful APIs, async/await, modern CSS

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your keys
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
   HF_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/ui`

## üîß API Endpoints

- `POST /generate` - Generate new flashcards from notes
- `GET /flashcards/<user_id>` - Get all flashcards for user
- `GET /flashcards/recent/<user_id>` - Get recent flashcards
- `GET /ui` - Serve the main interface
